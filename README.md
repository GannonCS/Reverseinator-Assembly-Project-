# Reverseinator-Assembly-Project-
This is an assembly project built in Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM). This project is titled 'Reverseinator' in which it will input a file ASCII Formated with a deliminator predefined (can be modiifed) and reverse it. This demonstrates my skills in Intel X86 Assembly Language in a fully developed project! (The name is a reference to Phineas and Ferb)
